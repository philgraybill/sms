<h1>Verbal SMS Opt-In Script</h1>

<p>
This page documents the exact verbal script used when SMS consent is obtained verbally.
</p>

<h2>Verbatim Script</h2>

<p>
The following script is read exactly as written to the recipient before any SMS messages are sent:
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
"You are requesting to receive SMS text messages from me at this phone number.
Messages will be conversational or informational in nature and sent at low frequency.
Message and data rates may apply.
You can reply STOP at any time to stop receiving messages, or HELP for assistance.
Do you consent to receive these SMS messages?"
</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Consent Confirmation</h2>

<p>
SMS messages are only sent after the recipient clearly responds with an affirmative consent.
</p>

<h2>Additional Notes</h2>

<p>
Verbal opt-in is optional and not the primary opt-in method. SMS consent may also be obtained
through written or electronic request. Regardless of method, consent is documented prior to
sending any SMS messages.
