About This Messaging Service

This is a personal, non-commercial SMS messaging service operated by an individual for low-volume, conversational and informational messaging.

Messages are sent only to a single, explicitly opted-in phone number and are not used for marketing, advertising, or bulk messaging.

This service is used to forward messages from a private Telegram group to a designated phone number for convenience.
